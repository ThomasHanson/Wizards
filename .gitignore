# WARNING: The following lines will ignore ALL .yml/.yaml files,
# but then re-include any that are inside your 'src' folder.
# This is the correct approach for Minecraft plugins, where you want to commit
# source files like 'plugin.yml' and 'config.yml' but ignore generated ones.

# Ignore all YAML files...
